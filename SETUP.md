## Code Along: Recyclable Item Detector

By the end of this session, you will have a fully functional web application that can detect recyclable items in images using Google's Cloud Vision API. The application will allow users to upload images, process them through a Flask backend server, and display the results in a user-friendly web interface.

## Prerequisites
- You must have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Head to https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

## Setup
1. Copy your `config.json` file from your Jupyter Notebook over to `/server` directory.

2. Navigate to the `server` directory and run the server on port `8000`.

3. Open `app.py` and setup CORS to allow requests from port `5173`.

4. Navigate to the `client` directory and install npm packages.

5. Open `networking.js` and ensure the backend URL is correct.

6. Run the frontend server on port `5173`.
